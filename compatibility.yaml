# This file treats “compatible” to mean:
#
#    A given license can be used (inbound / application dependency) and redistributed
#    (outbound / application) under the main application license without creating
#    a license conflict.
#
# In simpler terms: if you can take (dependency) code under License X, combine it
# with the main application code, and then distribute the whole under the main
# application's license, we mark X as compatible (c). If there is a known or likely
# conflict (or the situation is murky), we mark it as warning (w) or incompatible (i)
# accordingly.
#
# Inbound compatibility: “Can we redistribute this code under the main application license without conflict?”
#
# DISCLAIMER: This is NOT legal advice. License interactions can be nuanced.
#             If you need certainty, consult the official texts and a qualified
#             lawyer.

EUPL-1.2:
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Itself
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  EUPL-1.2:
    status: c
    reason: "EUPL-1.2 is always compatible with itself."

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # PERMISSIVE LICENSES
  #
  # Generally, permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, ISC, etc.) do NOT forbid re-licensing under
  # a stronger copyleft license like EUPL, so we label them "c" (compatible).
  #
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MIT:
    status: c
    reason: "MIT is permissive; code under MIT can be re-licensed under EUPL."

  BSD-2-Clause:
    status: c
    reason: "BSD-2-Clause is permissive; inbound re-licensing to EUPL is allowed."

  BSD-3-Clause:
    status: c
    reason: "BSD-3-Clause is also permissive; EUPL re-licensing does not conflict."

  BSD-Source-Code:
    status: c
    reason: >
      “BSD-Source-Code” (a.k.a. 4-clause BSD) adds an advertising clause, but
      it does not forbid relicensing under EUPL. The main requirement is to
      retain proper attribution in advertising materials.

  0BSD:
    status: c
    reason: >
      0BSD is effectively a public-domain-style license with zero clauses, so
      there are no restrictions preventing inbound re-licensing under EUPL-1.2.

  ISC:
    status: c
    reason: "ISC is a very permissive license, so EUPL re-licensing is fine."

  Apache-2.0:
    status: c
    reason: >
      Although there's complexity around patent clauses, EUPL 1.2 is generally
      interpreted as GPLv3-compatible, and Apache-2.0 is compatible with GPLv3.
      Therefore, inbound re-licensing to EUPL is typically not prohibited.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # GNU LICENSES
  #
  # Some of these are explicitly mentioned as "compatible" in the EUPL Appendix for
  # outbound re-licensing from EUPL to GPL. Inbound direction can be trickier,
  # especially for GPL v2 "only" vs. "or later."
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # GPL v2 (only)
  GPL-2.0-only:
    status: w
    reason: >
      If GPL-2.0 code lacks the "or later" clause, re-licensing to EUPL may be murky.
      Some argue EUPL's terms can conflict with strict GPL-2.0. Review on case-by-case basis.

  # GPL v2 (or later)
  GPL-2.0-or-later:
    status: c
    reason: >
      Code under GPL-2.0+ can generally be upgraded to GPL-3.0 or a GPL-3.0-compatible license.
      EUPL 1.2 is often treated as GPL-3.0-compatible, so inbound is acceptable.

  # GPL v3 (only)
  GPL-3.0-only:
    status: c
    reason: >
      EUPL is considered broadly compatible with GPL v3. You can typically
      integrate GPL-3.0 code and release under EUPL (though do verify text overlap carefully).

  # AGPL v3 (only)
  AGPL-3.0-only:
    status: c
    reason: >
      The EUPL Appendix lists AGPL-3.0 as outward-compatible, and inbound re-licensing to EUPL
      generally doesn't conflict because AGPL v3 terms are not stricter than EUPL.

  # LGPL 2.1 (only)
  LGPL-2.1-only:
    status: w
    reason: >
      This can be tricky, because LGPL-2.1 has some linking exceptions and no "or later" text by default.
      Often, you can relicense if there's an explicit "or later" clause. Otherwise, check carefully.

  # LGPL 2.1 (or later)
  LGPL-2.1-or-later:
    status: c
    reason: >
      Adding "or later" typically lets you upgrade to LGPL-3.0 or a GPL-3.0-compatible license,
      which EUPL broadly is. Usually this is safe inbound.

  # LGPL 3.0 (only)
  LGPL-3.0-only:
    status: c
    reason: "LGPL 3.0 is effectively a subset of GPL v3 terms, so inbound re-licensing to EUPL is allowed."

  # ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSES
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  EPL-1.0:
    status: w
    reason: >
      The older EPL-1.0 is not in the official EUPL “compatible licenses” list.
      Some say inbound re-licensing is possible with extra disclaimers, but there are nuances.

  EPL-2.0:
    status: c
    reason: >
      EUPL 1.2 includes EPL-2.0 in its Appendix (for outbound),
      and inbound direction is generally not contradictory.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MPL-1.1:
    status: w
    reason: >
      MPL-1.1 can be tricky to combine with other copyleft licenses. It's not in EUPL's
      official list. Often replaced by MPL-2.0. Review carefully.

  MPL-2.0:
    status: c
    reason: >
      EUPL 1.2 includes MPL-2.0 in its Appendix for outbound re-licensing,
      which generally implies inbound is acceptable.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # CeCILL LICENSES
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CeCILL-2.0:
    status: c
    reason: >
      EUPL 1.2 explicitly lists CeCILL v2.0 as an outbound-compatible license.
      Typically no conflict inbound.

  CeCILL-2.1:
    status: c
    reason: >
      EUPL 1.2 likewise lists CeCILL v2.1 as compatible. Inbound re-licensing to EUPL is fine.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # OPEN SOFTWARE LICENSES
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  OSL-2.1:
    status: c
    reason: >
      EUPL 1.2 references OSL in its Appendix. Inbound re-licensing is not prohibited.

  OSL-3.0:
    status: c
    reason: >
      OSL-3.0 is also in the EUPL Appendix for outbound. Generally considered inbound-compatible.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # OTHER COMMON LICENSES
  # (Mark them as "c", "w", or "i" based on known or likely conflicts)
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CDDL-1.0:
    status: w
    reason: >
      Combining CDDL code with copyleft licenses can lead to "dual-licensing"
      complexity (not in EUPL’s official list). Evaluate on a case-by-case basis.

  SSPL-1.0:
    status: i
    reason: >
      SSPL has unique requirements that are not generally seen as compatible
      with standard free/open licenses, including EUPL.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You can add or remove entries as needed. For any license not shown, make
# a judgement call: "c", "w", or "i" depending on whether it can be inbound-relicensed
# to the main license without conflicts.
